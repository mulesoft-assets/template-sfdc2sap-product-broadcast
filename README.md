# License Agreement <a name="licenseagreement"/>
Note that using this template is subject to the conditions of this [License Agreement](AnypointTemplateLicense.pdf).
Please review the terms of the license before downloading and using this template. In short, you are allowed to use the template for free with Mule ESB Enterprise Edition, CloudHub, or as a trial in Anypoint Studio.

# Use Case <a name="usecase"/>
This Anypoint Template should serve as a foundation for setting an online sync of products/materials from Salesforce to SAP.
Everytime there is a new product or a change in already existing one in Salesforce instance, the template will fetch it and upsert it in SAP.
			
Requirements have been set not only to be used as examples, but also to establish a starting point to adapt your integration to your requirements.
			
As implemented, this Anypoint Template leverage the [Batch Module](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Batch+Processing).
The batch job is divided into *Process* and *On Complete* stages.
The integration is triggered by scheduler to Salesforce products. New or modified products with non-empty product code are passed to the batch as input.
In the batch the material is fetched from SAP by its `ProductCode`. Depending on the result, the product is then created or updated in SAP.
Finally during the *On Complete* stage the Anypoint Template will log output statistics data into the console.

# Considerations <a name="considerations"/>

To make this Anypoint Template run, there are certain preconditions that must be considered. All of them deal with the preparations in both, that must be made in order for all to run smoothly.
**Failling to do so could lead to unexpected behavior of the template.**

# Run it! <a name="runit"/>
Simple steps to get SFDC2SAP-product-broadcast running.


## Running on premise <a name="runonopremise"/>
In this section we detail the way you should run your Anypoint Template on your computer.


### Where to Download Mule Studio and Mule ESB
First thing to know if you are a newcomer to Mule is where to get the tools.

+ You can download Mule Studio from this [Location](http://www.mulesoft.com/platform/mule-studio)
+ You can download Mule ESB from this [Location](http://www.mulesoft.com/platform/soa/mule-esb-open-source-esb)


### Importing an Anypoint Template into Studio
Mule Studio offers several ways to import a project into the workspace, for instance: 

+ Anypoint Studio Project from File System
+ Packaged mule application (.jar)

You can find a detailed description on how to do so in this [Documentation Page](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Importing+and+Exporting+in+Studio).


### Running on Studio <a name="runonstudio"/>
Once you have imported you Anypoint Template into Anypoint Studio you need to follow these steps to run it:

+ Locate the properties file `mule.dev.properties`, in src/main/resources
+ Complete all the properties required as per the examples in the section [Properties to be configured](#propertiestobeconfigured)
+ Once that is done, right click on you Anypoint Template project folder 
+ Hover you mouse over `"Run as"`
+ Click on  `"Mule Application (configure)"`
+ Inside the dialog, select Environment and set the variable `"mule.env"` to the value `"dev"`
+ Click `"Run"`
In order to make this Anypoint Template run on Anypoint Studio there are a few extra steps that need to be made.
Please check this Documentation Page:

+ [Enabling Your Studio Project for SAP](https://docs.mulesoft.com/connectors/sap-connector#configuring-the-connector-in-studio-7)

### Running on Mule ESB stand alone <a name="runonmuleesbstandalone"/>
Complete all properties in one of the property files, for example in [mule.prod.properties] (../master/src/main/resources/mule.prod.properties) and run your app with the corresponding environment variable to use it. To follow the example, this will be `mule.env=prod`. 


## Running on CloudHub <a name="runoncloudhub"/>
While [creating your application on CloudHub](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Hello+World+on+CloudHub) (Or you can do it later as a next step), you need to go to Deployment > Advanced to set all environment variables detailed in **Properties to be configured** as well as the **mule.env**.


### Deploying your Anypoint Template on CloudHub <a name="deployingyouranypointtemplateoncloudhub"/>
Mule Studio provides you with really easy way to deploy your Template directly to CloudHub, for the specific steps to do so please check this [link](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Deploying+Mule+Applications#DeployingMuleApplications-DeploytoCloudHub)


## Properties to be configured (With examples) <a name="propertiestobeconfigured"/>

# API Calls <a name="apicalls"/>
Salesforce imposes limits on the number of API Calls that can be made. However, in this template, only one call per poll cycle is done to retrieve all the information required.


# Customize It!<a name="customizeit"/>
This brief guide intends to give a high level idea of how this Anypoint Template is built and how you can change it according to your needs.
As mule applications are based on XML files, this page will be organized by describing all the XML that conform the Anypoint Template.
Of course more files will be found such as Test Classes and [Mule Application Files](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Application+Format), but to keep it simple we will focus on the XMLs.

Here is a list of the main XML files you'll find in this application:

* [config.xml](#configxml)
* [endpoints.xml](#endpointsxml)
* [businessLogic.xml](#businesslogicxml)
* [errorHandling.xml](#errorhandlingxml)


## config.xml<a name="configxml"/>
Configuration for Connectors and [Configuration Properties](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Configuring+Properties) are set in this file. **Even you can change the configuration here, all parameters that can be modified here are in properties file, and this is the recommended place to do it so.** Of course if you want to do core changes to the logic you will probably need to modify this file.

In the visual editor they can be found on the *Global Element* tab.


## businessLogic.xml<a name="businesslogicxml"/>
Functional aspect of the Anypoint Template is implemented on this XML, directed by a batch job that will be responsible for creations/updates. The several message processors constitute four high level actions that fully implement the logic of this Anypoint Template:
1. The integration is triggered by scheduler to Salesforce Products. New or modified products are passed to the batch as input.
2. In the batch the material is fetched from SAP by its `ProductCode`. Depending on the result, the product is then created or updated in SAP.
3. Finally during the *On Complete* stage the Anypoint Template will log output statistics data into the console.



## endpoints.xml<a name="endpointsxml"/>
This file is conformed by two Flows.
The first one we'll call it **scheduler** flow. This one contains the Scheduler endpoint that will periodically trigger **query** flow and then executing the batch job process.
The second one we'll call it **query** flow. This one contains watermarking logic that will be querying Salesforce for updated/created Products that meet the defined criteria in the query since the last polling. The last invocation timestamp is stored by using Objectstore Component and updated after each Salesforce query.



## errorHandling.xml<a name="errorhandlingxml"/>
This is the right place to handle how your integration will react depending on the different exceptions. 
This file holds a [Error Handling](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Error+Handling) that is referenced by the main flow in the business logic.
